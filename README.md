# Weather-the-Storm


## Description

This is a weather dashboard with form inputs that allows you to search for a city and view current and future weather conditions for that city. The dashboard also keeps track of your search history, so you can quickly view the weather for cities you've searched for before.


## Features:

- Search for a city to view current and future weather conditions.
- View current weather conditions, including city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- View future weather conditions for the next 5 days, including date, weather icon, temperature, and wind speed.
- Click on a city in the search history to view current and future weather conditions for that city again.


## How to use:

1. Enter a city name into the form input and click "Search".
2. The dashboard will display the current and future weather conditions for that city.
3. To view future weather conditions, scroll down the page.
4. To view the weather for a city in your search history, click on that city in the list.


## Example:

1. Enter "San Francisco, CA" into the form input and click "Search".
2. The dashboard will display the current and future weather conditions for San Francisco, CA.
3. The current weather conditions will include the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
4. The future weather conditions will include the date, weather icon, temperature, and wind speed for the next 5 days.
5. To view the weather for another city in your search history, click on that city in the list.
